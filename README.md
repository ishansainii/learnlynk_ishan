# LearnLynk – Technical Assessment 

Thanks for taking the time to complete this assessment. The goal is to understand how you think about problems and how you structure real project work. This is a small, self-contained exercise that should take around **2–3 hours**. It’s completely fine if you don’t finish everything—just note any assumptions or TODOs.

We use:

- **Supabase Postgres**
- **Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript)**
- **Next.js + TypeScript**

You may use your own free Supabase project.

---

## Overview

There are four technical tasks:

1. Database schema — `backend/schema.sql`  
2. RLS policies — `backend/rls_policies.sql`  
3. Edge Function — `backend/edge-functions/create-task/index.ts`  
4. Next.js page — `frontend/pages/dashboard/today.tsx`  

There is also a short written question about Stripe in this README.

Feel free to use Supabase/PostgreSQL docs, or any resource you normally use.

---

## Task 1 — Database Schema

File: `backend/schema.sql`

Create the following tables:

- `leads`  
- `applications`  
- `tasks`  

Each table should include standard fields:

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
tenant_id uuid not null,
created_at timestamptz default now(),
updated_at timestamptz default now()
```

Additional requirements:

- `applications.lead_id` → FK to `leads.id`  
- `tasks.application_id` → FK to `applications.id`  
- `tasks.type` should only allow: `call`, `email`, `review`  
- `tasks.due_at >= tasks.created_at`  
- Add reasonable indexes for typical queries:  
  - Leads: `tenant_id`, `owner_id`, `stage`  
  - Applications: `tenant_id`, `lead_id`  
  - Tasks: `tenant_id`, `due_at`, `status`  

---

## Task 2 — Row-Level Security

File: `backend/rls_policies.sql`

We want:

- Counselors can see:
  - Leads they own, or  
  - Leads assigned to any team they belong to  
- Admins can see all leads belonging to their tenant

Assume the existence of:

```
users(id, tenant_id, role)
teams(id, tenant_id)
user_teams(user_id, team_id)
```

JWT contains:

- `user_id`
- `role`
- `tenant_id`

Tasks:

1. Enable RLS on `leads`  
2. Write a **SELECT** policy enforcing the rules above  
3. Write an **INSERT** policy that allows counselors/admins to add leads under their tenant  

---

## Task 3 — Edge Function: create-task

File: `backend/edge-functions/create-task/index.ts`

Write a simple POST endpoint that:

### Input:
```json
{
  "application_id": "uuid",
  "task_type": "call",
  "due_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Requirements:
- Validate:
  - `task_type` is `call`, `email`, or `review`
  - `due_at` is a valid *future* timestamp  
- Insert a row into `tasks` using the service role key  
- Return:

```json
{ "success": true, "task_id": "..." }
```

On validation error → return **400**  
On internal errors → return **500**

---

## Task 4 — Frontend Page: `/dashboard/today`

File: `frontend/pages/dashboard/today.tsx`

Build a small page that:

- Fetches tasks due **today** (status ≠ completed)  
- Uses the provided Supabase client  
- Displays:  
  - type  
  - application_id  
  - due_at  
  - status  
- Adds a “Mark Complete” button that updates the task in Supabase  

---

## Task 5 — Stripe Checkout (Written Answer)

Add a section titled:

```
## Stripe Answer
```

Write **8–12 lines** describing how you would implement a Stripe Checkout flow for an application fee, including:

- When you insert a `payment_requests` row  
- When you call Stripe  
- What you store from the checkout session  
- How you handle webhooks  
- How you update the application after payment succeeds  


```
## Stripe Answer

To handle an application fee, I would start by creating a Stripe Checkout Session from the backend.
When the user initiates payment, the backend generates a Checkout Session that includes the application ID, the amount, and redirect URLs for success and cancellation. Before redirecting the user, I would store a payment_request entry containing the session ID, application ID, and a status set to “pending”.

The actual success or failure of a payment should never be trusted from the client side, so the system relies on a Stripe webhook.
I would configure a /stripe/webhook endpoint to listen for checkout.session.completed. When Stripe calls this webhook, I would verify the event signature, then mark the payment_request as “paid” and update the related application’s stage (for example, from “awaiting fee” to “submitted” or “processing”).

If Stripe notifies that the session expired or payment failed, the webhook would update the status accordingly.
This ensures the payment workflow is accurate even if the user closes their browser midway through checkout.

```

## Submission

1. Push your work to a public GitHub repo.  
2. Add your Stripe answer at the bottom of this file.  
3. Share the link.

Good luck.
